Really hard to parse out an artist and their information. Had to convert to dictionary and go through all the layers.

Inconsistent return object. For example, the artist information returned in chart_artists is different from artist_get.
artist_get provided more information for an artist than chart_artists. If we are to define a class for it, we would have
to include all possible fields and then somehow populate them all for all calls to artist related methods.
